TODO_DPS
$Id$

These are the items required to be done before DPS can be released
for broader use.

TODO:

 Client:
 ------
- Implement support for an encrypted ICS filetype to enable DPS to
  have on-server encryption.
- Clean the text of error messages in DPS_SendData().
- Handle MOTD

 Server:
 ------
- Implement connection encryption
- Clean %Security once every day
- Clean up ghost connections (timeout on 5-10 minutes?)
- Allow encrypted connections
- Add MOTD command
- Add a SETTINGS command (gives info about the settings for the user):
	Client: SETTINGS
	Server reply: Encrypted=1 GenHTML=0
- Add a CHANGE command:
	CHANGE SET [SETTING] [NEWSETTING]
	CHANGE PASSWORD [OLDPASSWORD] [NEWPASSWORD]

 Other:
 -----
- Write a document on how to communicate with the DPS.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

DONE:

 Client:
 ------
- Get the client working
- Don't ask the user if she wants to resolve the conflicts. It is required
  to avoid data loss.
- Log conflicts in DPS_RepairData.
- Use the DPS error function in DPS_RepairData.
- Do a forced DPS_BackupData on DPS_RepairData failure.
- Add conflict resolving on download (don't blindly trust it).

 Server:
 ------
- Get a working services daemon
- Move $Port to the config
- Use the config a lot more
- Implement --conffile and use it, but fallback to a config in ./
