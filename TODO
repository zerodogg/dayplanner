TODO file for Day Planner.
An up to date version of this file can always be found in the Day Planner
subversion repository. The version information are only approximates and
may be subject to change.
===========================================================================

* Version 0.8
- - - - - - -
- Left align labels
- Add support for choosing how long an event lasts
- Write a simple way of plugging in functionality into DP::iCalendar.
	So that one might for instance plug Date::HolidayParser into
	DP::iCalendar, thus having Date::HolidayParser add UIDs to
	DP::iCalendar and making the holidays available there.
	Then when changed DP::iCalendar simply tells Date::HolidayParser
	about the change instead. Date::HolidayParser can then either
	make the change to the holiday file itself (unlikely for
	 advanced holidays), or add the event to the iCalendar file
	itself, dropping it from its local file.
- Have a third party look over all strings (in the pot-file) and try to
	simplify those too technical

* Longer term
- - - - - - -
- What: Write a dayplanner-daemon wrapper around evolution-data-server to enable
  Day Planner to take advantage of it and integrate better with the GNOME
  environment.
  When: This would require dbus support in the evolution-data-server.
	This is planned for GNOME 2.20.
