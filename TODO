TODO file for Day Planner.
An up to date version of this file can always be found in the Day Planner
subversion repository. The version information are only approximates and
may be subject to change.
===========================================================================

* Version 0.8
- - - - - - -
- Have a third party look over all strings (in the pot-file) and try to
	simplify those too technical

* Version 0.9
- - - - - - -
- Use Conduit for synchronization of Calendars (except when using
	DPServices). Offer:
	- Sync with online server
		- Just add minor things to the current Synchronization
			interface
	- Sync with device
		- Calendar -> Synchronize with device ?
- Add support for choosing how long an event lasts
- Left align labels

* Longer term
- - - - - - -
- What: Write a dayplanner-daemon wrapper around evolution-data-server to enable
  Day Planner to take advantage of it and integrate better with the GNOME
  environment.
  When: This would require dbus support in the evolution-data-server.
	This is planned for GNOME 2.20.
