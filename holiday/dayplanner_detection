# Day planner holiday detection definitions
# $Id$
#
# This file defines which holiday files to use for which countries.
#
# The syntax is:
# LC_ADDRESS=NAME
# Where LC_ADDRESS is your LC_ADDRESS environment variable value and
#  NAME is your the name of the holiday file to use. Skip any charset
#  definition in LC_ADDRESS.
#  If your country has a distinct first part (such as Sweden has) you don't
#  need to include the part after the "_" in the LC_ADDRESS. For instance
#  swedish definitions could be written using sv= instead of sv_SV=,
#  while US definitions has to be en_US= because their first part is
#  used by multiple countries.
# Example:
# nn_NO=norway
# Skip the holiday_ part of the filename.
# EVERYTHING is case sensitive.
