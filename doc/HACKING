1 - COMMENTING
==============
Day Planner aims at having a extendible and well documented codebase.
Commenting is an important part of this. The main rule would be that
"it is better to comment too much than too little". And really, it's
hard to comment code too much.

1.1 - Subroutines
-- -- -- -- -- --
Before each subroutine decleration you should have comments describing
the purpose and usage syntax of the subroutine. Like this:

# Purpose: The purpose of the subroutine
# Usage: Subroutine(ARG1, ARG2);

1.1.1 - Real world examples
-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
# Purpose: Detect which kind of event is selected in the eventlist
# Usage: my $Type = GetEventListType();
sub GetEventListType {
	...
}

# Purpose: Close a window when the escape key is pressed
# Usage: $WIDGET->signal_connect("key_release_event" => \&EscapeKeyHandler);
sub EscapeKeyHandler  {
	...
}

# Purpose: Display an information dialog
# Usage: DPInfo("Information message");
sub DPInfo ($) {
	...
}

1.2 - General commenting
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
Also generally you should comment anything unless it is completely
obvious what the code does (that the code is logical self
documenting). If the code is longer than 10 lines then don't assume
that the code is self documenting.

An example of self documenting code:
# Purpose: Send something to the daemon and then return the daemons reply
# Usage: $Reply = Daemon_DataSegment(DATA);
sub Daemon_DataSegment ($) {
        if($DaemonOnline) {
                if(Daemon_SendData($_[0])) {
                        return(Daemon_ErrorHandler(Daemon_GetData()));
                }
        } else {
                return("ERR NOT_ONLINE");
        }
}

An example of code that is not completely self-documenting:
# Purpose: Save the data file and redraw the needed windows
# Usage: UpdatedData();
sub UpdatedData () {
        # Save the data
        SaveMainData();
        # Redraw the event list
        DrawEventlist();
        # Redraw the calendar
        CalendarChange();
}

The reason is that CalendarChange() isn't obviously a subroutine that
redraws the calendar.

2 - SUBROUTINES
===============
If something can be a subroutine then generally it should be a
subroutine (exceptions are the initial calling of subroutines and
commandline parsing).

Additionally the subroutines should be modular. That is that if the
subroutine does more than one thing and one of the functions it
provides can be performed without having to perform the latter
functions first then it should be an own subroutine.
An example for this is the daemon functions. In the beginning
StartDaemon() and ConnectToDaemon() was one single subroutine. This
became troublesome as Day Planner may need to reconnect to a
disconnected daemon, thus calling that subroutine again. It would be
useless to go through the entire process of starting a daemon when all
you really want to do is reconnect to it.


3 - DEPENDENCIES
================
NOTE: The dayplanner-services-daemon is excempt from this policy.

Day Planner has few dependencies by design. A good rule of thumb here
is that if a dependency can be skipped then it should unless it is
included in the base perl distribution and have been for multiple
releases.

So if a useful module is already included in the perl base
distribution (for instance like Getopt::Long and File::Basename) or is
included in the Gtk2 perl base distribution (for instance like
Gtk2::Gdk::Keysyms) then by all means use it, as long as the module
isn't brand new.

Currently the non-Gtk2 and non-perl-base-distribution modules day
planner uses are:
Locale::gettext
Date::HolidayParser (though, this one is bundled with Day Planner)

4 - API changes
===============
This section is about changes to the APIs of Day Planner dependencies.
An API should be static. The way we use File::Basename now should work
in future versions too. However, sometimes a more powerful or useful
function is appended to the API and some older API is deprecated.

Day Planner reacts to depreciation of APIs in use by it in the
following way:
- If the function is replaced by another module not provided alongside the
  module we already use and not provided in the perl base distribution
  then continue to use the old API as long as we can.
- If the old function has been completely removed then try to rewrite
  it to be included in the Day Planner source code. If this is not
  possible then we would have to discuss how to solve this.
- If the API is just simply deprecated but nothing more then continue
  to use it.
A good rule is that Day Planner should for now run on the following
reference systems: Mandriva Linux 2006.0, Debian Unstable, Mandriva
Linux Cooker, Latest official Mandriva Linux.
