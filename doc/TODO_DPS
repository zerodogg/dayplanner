DONE:

 Client:
 ------
- Get the client working
- Don't ask the user if she wants to resolve the conflicts. It is required
  to avoid data loss.
- Log conflicts in DPS_RepairData.
- Use the DPS error function in DPS_RepairData.
- Do a forced DPS_BackupData on DPS_RepairData failure.
- Add conflict resolving on download (don't blindly trust it).
- Clean the text of error messages in DPS_SendData().

 Server:
 ------
- Get a working services daemon
- Move $Port to the config
- Use the config a lot more
- Implement --conffile and use it, but fallback to a config in ./
- Clean up ghost connections (kicks old connections when a new one
	tries to auth as the same user)
- Implement connection encryption
- Allow encrypted connections
