Plan to Day Planner migration notes
$Id$
-----------------------------------

The conversion between the plan data format and the day planner data format is lossy.
This means that you can loose data. The current limitations are:
- It doesn't accept recurring appointments. That means that "repeat until", "repeat forever" and
	such is lost. Day planner does not support this yet. The appointment isn't lost, but it
	will not be repeated.
	NOTE: Recurring appointments that reoccur once a year is NOT lost
- It doesn't accept scripts that are to be run. This is because day planner does not support
	this feature, and probably won't do so any time soon.
- Warning times are lost. Day Planner implements this differently from plan, and
	the plan way can not be layered upon the day planner way.
- The holiday file is ignored.
- All colour coding is lost, this is a plan-specific feature not present in day planner.

What it DOES support is:
- Conversion of normal appointments, including the details
- Conversion of appointments recurring once a year
