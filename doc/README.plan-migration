Plan to Day Planner migration notes
$Id$
-----------------------------------

The conversion between the plan data format and the Day Planner data format is lossy.
This means that you can loose data. The current limitations are:
- It doesn't accept recurring appointments. That means that "repeat until", "repeat forever" and
	such is lost. Day Planner does support this, but support for converting plan
	recurrances to DP-recurrances has not been added (and is not planned).
	The appointment is not lost, but it won't be repeated
	NOTE: Recurring appointments that just reoccur once a year is NOT lost
- It doesn't accept scripts that are to be run. This is because Day Planner does not support
	this feature, and most likely never will.
- Warning times are lost. Day Planner implements this differently from plan, and
	the plan way can not be layered upon the Day Planner way.
- The holiday file is ignored.
- All colour coding is lost, this is a plan-specific feature not present in Day Planner.

What it DOES support is:
- Conversion of normal appointments, including the details
- Conversion of appointments recurring once a year
