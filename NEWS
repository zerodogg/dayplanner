  multi line packets

  function

Version 0.1.1 (Released on the 24th of May 2006)
------------------------------------------------
* Client (dayplanner)
- Attempts to restart dayplanner-daemon when recieving SIGPIPE
- Now it won't attempt to tell the daemon to reload its configuration files
  when the daemon hasn't been started. This avoids a useless (and harmless)
  warning the first time day planner is started.

  edit without having something to edit selected
- Handles daemon errors better and is more verbose about them
- Fixed a simple fixme where we looped over a command without having to

  while it was running.

- Now places the pop up dialogs on top of the main window

* Daemon (dayplanner-daemon)
- -d is now an alias for --dayplannerdir
- -s/--socketname now sets the name of the socket, is not required
- Added NOTIFICATION commands. The notifier can now get the information
  it needs after being launched so that it doesn't show up in "ps aux"

* Notifier (dayplanner-notifier)
- Now uses the id from --id to get the information from the daemon after
  launch (the old legacy syntax is supported so that the notifier can be used
   in scripts)
- No longer tries to connect to the daemon when run from the commandline

Version 0.1 (Released on the 19th of April 2006)
------------------------------------------------
- Initial release
